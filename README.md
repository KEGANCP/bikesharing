### Project Overview
While reminiscing on my recent trip to New York City, I realized one of my favorite recurring memories was the time spent on a bikeshare amenity which was available through-out the city. This ignited an idea to bring this convenience and enjoyment to my hometown of Des Moines, AI. I collected data from CitiBike in NYC to analyze some pertinent information to review; to make this dream a reality. Within the following summary I will outline a presentation I prepared to display to potential investors.

### Project Summary

The CitiBike Campaign has flourished in a huge tourist spot like New York City. We have have identified a substantial amount of information through these visualizations; we understand now that bike sharing has primarily been utilized by males, we also undertand the peak hours of utilization, and much more that we can use to determine the success of CitiBike in Des Moines, Iowa. There are a few more variables to consider, a significant one is the size and populous difference of NYC & Des Moines. I would recommend further analysis on the below 2 items to get a better idea how to best prepare to CitiBike in Des Moines:
- What is the utilization of CitiBike in NYC totals for visitors compared to residents?
- What is our population & average tourist difference between NYC and Des Moines?

With some more analysis, we are not far from having enough details to present to our investors to bring CitiBike to Des Moines!
