### Project Overview
While reminiscing on my recent trip to New York City, I realized one of my favorite recurring memories was the time spent on a bikeshare amenity which was available through-out the city. This ignited an idea to bring this convenience and enjoyment to my hometown of Des Moines, AI. I collected data from CitiBike in NYC to analyze some pertinent information to review; to make this dream a reality. Within the following summary I will outline a presentation I prepared to display to potential investors.
